The data bus:
	The connection pins between the CPU and memory (RAM).
	It is like a transport mechanism when data is sent between CPU and memory.

The fetch execution cycle:
	The CPU reads in instructions from memory
	and executes them one at a time.

	1. The Program Counter (PC) register contains a number,
	   which is the address of the next instruction (which is also a number)
	   to be executed.

	2. The CPU fetches the next instruction number from memory(pointed to by PC)
	   via the data bus and passes it to the instruction decoder, which decodes
           the number into some instruction.

	3. Depending on the decoded instruction, the CPU uses it's registers for 
	   temporary storage of the data, before it is passed back to the memory via
	   the data bus.  

	4. For the actual calculation to happen, the data is passed along to the 
	   Arithmetical Logical Unit (ALU), which is a part of the CPU. 
	   Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.
